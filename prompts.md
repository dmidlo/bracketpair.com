# bracketpair.com

build a list manipulation tool as a react component and host it on github pages.
use vite and typescript for the development environment.
this will a front-end only component as it will be hosted on github pages.
the component will be part of my portfolio website which we are going to build here as well; consider it the app in which this component will be used.
meet all applicable accessibility standards (color-contrast, etc)
the entire project will be hosted on github pages.  I'm not sure how to do routing.  I'd like the app/portfolio site to have a section that is open-to-the-public, but where I am the target audience.
