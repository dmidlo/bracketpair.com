###### Requirements

```markdown
build a list manipulation and deduplication tool as a react component and host it on github pages.
I've never done this before; but I do have 10 years of IT infrastructure and Security experience, and I've developed two medium sized software packages that get 2,000 downloads a month.
Again though, this will a front-end only component as it will be hosted on github pages.
the component will be part of my portfolio website which we are going to build here as well; consider it the app in which this component will be used.
start with test driven design this time; make sure we include this at every appropriate point.
I also want to meet all applicable accessibility standards (ARIA, color-contrast, etc)
I'm not sure how to do routing.
I'd like the app/portfolio site to have a section that is open-to-the-public, but where I am the target audience.
This app will need LTR/RTL support as part of the MVP since it's primary purpose will be working with lists of english and arabic words.
ENSURE A MINIMALIST'S BLEND OF TEST-DRIVEN-DEVELOPMENT, BEAUTIFUL DESIGN-THINKING PRACTICES, AND THE SECURE-SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT-LIFECYCLE.
ENSURE ONLY BROWSER TECHNOLOGIES ARE UTILIZED AS THIS IS A FRONT-END-ONLY APP.
