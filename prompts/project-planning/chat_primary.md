###### Requirements

```markdown
build a list manipulation and deduplication tool as a react component and host it on github pages.
I've never done this before; but I do have 10 years of IT infrastructure and Security experience, and I've developed two medium sized software packages that get 2,000 downloads a month.
Again though, this will a front-end only component as it will be hosted on github pages.
the component will be part of my portfolio website which we are going to build here as well; consider it the app in which this component will be used.
start with test driven design this time; make sure we include this at every appropriate point.
I also want to meet all applicable accessibility standards (ARIA, color-contrast, etc)
I'm not sure how to do routing.
I'd like the app/portfolio site to have a section that is open-to-the-public, but where I am the target audience.
This app will need LTR/RTL support as part of the MVP since it's primary purpose will be working with lists of english and arabic words.
ENSURE A MINIMALIST'S BLEND OF TEST-DRIVEN-DEVELOPMENT, BEAUTIFUL DESIGN-THINKING PRACTICES, AND THE SECURE-SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT-LIFECYCLE.
ENSURE ONLY BROWSER TECHNOLOGIES ARE UTILIZED AS THIS IS A FRONT-END-ONLY APP.

### Notes

### Revised Notes Section for the # LanguageToggleAgileFeatureCard

---

### Notes

In developing the Language Toggle feature, it's essential to be cognizant of several key areas that may not be immediately apparent but are crucial for the project's success. Below are some of these important considerations:

#### Tips

- **CSS Styling**: Be aware that simply flipping the layout might break some CSS. Utilize logical properties like `margin-inline-start` instead of `margin-left` for better adaptability.
  
- **State Hydration**: If using Server-Side Rendering (SSR), remember to correctly hydrate the state so that the client and server are in sync with regards to language and directionality.

#### Pointers

- **Event Handling**: Make sure that events like `onClick` or `onChange` work as expected post toggle. These are often overlooked during RTL testing.
  
- **Animation**: Any animations should also be mirrored when toggling between LTR and RTL.

#### Gotchas

- **Scrolling Behavior**: Check how the scroll behaves, especially in carousels and slideshows. They should align with the language direction.

- **Conditional Rendering**: If components are conditionally rendered, make sure their state is maintained or properly reset during a toggle.

#### Warnings

- **Text Concatenation**: Be wary of directly concatenating translated strings, as sentence structures can change significantly in different languages, breaking the logic.
  
- **Nested Components**: Pay attention to components within components. A parent component switching from LTR to RTL might not trigger a switch in a nested component.

#### Vocabulary

- **Localization (l10n)**: The adaptation of a product or content to meet the language, cultural, and other requirements of a specific target market.
  
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: The process of designing a software application so that it can potentially be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.

#### Organizations to Consult

- **W3C**: For guidelines on web standards including internationalization and accessibility.
  
- **IETF**: For best practices on language tags and locale identifiers.

#### Checklists

1. **Pre-Development**
    - [ ] Design Mockup
    - [ ] Accessibility Audit
    - [ ] Translate Labels

2. **Development**
    - [ ] Implement Redux
    - [ ] Develop UI
    - [ ] Add Unit Tests

3. **Post-Development**
    - [ ] Cross-Browser Testing
    - [ ] Performance Testing
    - [ ] Accessibility Re-Audit

By taking these into consideration, you not only ensure that the feature is robust and user-friendly but also that it can be seamlessly integrated into larger projects while meeting all accessibility guidelines.
