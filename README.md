###### AgileProjectFeaturesByTheme

```markdown
- Input Management:
  1. Input Field(s) for List Items & Manual Addition: Users can enter list items either as a comma-separated list in a single input field or individually in separate fields.
  2. Data Validation and Quality Checker: Alert the user if the format of the data is incorrect or inconsistent (useful for number-based or date-based lists).

  4. Auto-complete: Suggest possible list items as the user types, based on the current list or a predefined set.
  5. Clipboard Watcher: Watch the clipboard for new data and suggest adding it to the list.
  6. Tag Autocompletion and Auto-Tagging: Suggest or automatically assign tags based on the current item being added or edited.
  7. Automatic Item Classification: Use machine learning algorithms to automatically categorize list items as they are added.
  8. Import from Web: Directly import lists from a webpage by specifying the URL.
- Duplication Management:
  1. Duplicate Identification & Count: Real-time ability to identify duplicates and show them to the user along with the count of duplicate items for each list item.
  2. Case Sensitivity Toggle & Whitespace Sensitivity: Option to consider or ignore case and leading/trailing whitespaces when identifying duplicates.
  3. Manual Deduplication & Preview: Provide checkboxes next to duplicates to allow manual selection and removal.
  4. Auto Deduplication: Automatically remove duplicate items from the list.
  5. Smart Deduplication and Anomaly Detection: Suggest potential deduplications based on similar items, not just exact matches. Use machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in the list.
  6. Regex-based Deduplication: Advanced users can enter a regex pattern to match duplicates.
  7. Notifications and Alerts: Push notifications for instant duplicate alerts.
  8. Audio Notifications and Auditory Cues: Auditory signals for significant events like adding an item or identifying duplicates.
- Sorting and Filtering:
  1. Search Functionality: Allow users to search through the list items quickly.
  2. Dynamic Filtering & Data Validation: Filter items in real-time based on user-defined conditions, like string matching or numerical ranges.
  3. Sort Options & Multi-Level Sorting: Ability to sort the list in ascending, descending, or original order, and by multiple criteria.
  4. Quick Summarization and NLP: Generate a quick summary of the list items using natural language processing.
  5. Conditional Sorting and Conflict Resolution: Sort based on multiple attributes. Handle conflicts in multi-user mode and maintain a detailed log of sorting activities.
  6. Fuzzy Sorting: Sort by approximate string matching.
  7. Location-Based Sorting and Geo-Tagging and Geofencing: Sort and filter items based on geolocation information. Trigger actions or notifications based on the geographical location of the user.
  8. Batch Transformation: Schedule multiple items for transformations like 'convert to uppercase' based on common settings.
- Data Organization and Display:
  1. Pagination: Implement pagination for long lists.
  2. Tagging/Categorizing: Allow users to tag or categorize list items for better organization.
  3. Item Notes and Time-Tracking: Allow users to add notes or comments to individual list items. Record the time spent on eaclist item.
  4. Drag and Drop: Allow manual rearrangement of the list order using drag and drop.
  5. Favorites/Bookmarks & Context Menu: Option to mark certain items as favorites or bookmarks. Right-click to open a conxt menu with options like delete, move, copy, etc.
  6. Multi-Column Support: Ability to treat each list item as a record with multiple fields or columns.
  7. Hierarchy Visualization and Milestone Tracking: A visual representation of hierarchical relationships between list ite, like a tree view. Track goals related to hierarchical items.
  8. List Item Dependencies and Version Control: Indicate if some list items depend on others and adjust sorting/processing accdingly. Ability to revert the list and individual items to previous versions.
  9. Variable Layouts and Data Visualization: Option to view the list in different layouts such as cards, table, or detailed view. Represent list data in visual formats like charts or graphs.
  10. Heatmaps and Usage Analytics: Visual indicators and statistics to show user interaction with the list items.
- Export and Backup:
  1. Export Options & Import/Export Formats: Ability to export the deduplicated list to a text file, clipboard, or multiple formats like CSV, JSON, etc.
  2. OCR and Data Import/Export: Import lists from images using OCR technology. Integrate with third-party services for additional data import/export capabilities.
  3. Export Profiles: Save various exporting settings profiles so users can easily export lists with the same settings in the future.
  4. Local and Server-side Backups: Options to create backups on the user's machine and, as a stretch goal, server-side.
  5. Data Encryption: Options to encrypt sensitive list data.
  6. Version Control and Item Versioning: Ability to revert the list and individual items to previous versions.

  4. Auto Deduplication: Automatically remove duplicate items from the list.
  5. Smart Deduplication and Anomaly Detection: Suggest potential deduplications based on similar items, not just exact matches. Use machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in the list.
  6. Regex-based Deduplication: Advanced users can enter a regex pattern to match duplicates.
  7. Notifications and Alerts: Push notifications for instant duplicate alerts.
  8. Audio Notifications and Auditory Cues: Auditory signals for significant events like adding an item or identifying duplicates.
